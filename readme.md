# What is this Project?
This is a silly little repository with some silly little files that exist merely to practice with git and github. I could have named this repo _Camelot_, for tis a silly place, but I chose to be as literal as possible -- because _future me_ prefers this sort of clarity.

# How to Contribute
Thanks for jumping into this repo to fix stuff! Though honestly, if you're not my brother, [@tomrich82](tomrich82), this is probably not the place for you. We're just tinkering around here and he needs to be the one knocking out issues and submitting PRs. If you feel sad about this, please hop over to the [StockAid](https://github.com/GratefulGarmentProject/StockAid) repo and help them to maintain their Rails app that serves victims of sexual assault in the Los Angeles area.
